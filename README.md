## Description

This project was created by Archer Nicholson in partnership with the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp Course.

The Professional README Generator is a simple but helpful tool for developers to create a README.md file quickly in the command line. It requires Node.js to run and uses MarkDown syntax to format the file and creates the file straight into the 'Develop' directory to be added to your project's GitHub Repository.

## Installation

This project requires Node.js to run properly. The Node.js command line application can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/. Follow the instructions to download the most recent Node.js version for your computer.

Once you have Node.js installed, go to the Professional README Generator repository and copy the link under the green 'Code' button. Then, go to your Git Bash terminal and type 'git clone <repo link>' in the file you would like the application. After installing the application, go to the Node.js terminal and type 'node index.js' to run your application.

## Usage

To use this project, run your Node.js terminal and go to the file where the application is stored. Once there, type the command 'node index.js' to run the application. Follow the prompts in your command line until you reach the end and all questions have been answered about your project. You should see a success message and your new README.md file will be stored in the 'Develop' directory of the application's files. Now your README.md is available to use for your projects!
